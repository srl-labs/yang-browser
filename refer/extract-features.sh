# this script extracts yang features from all supported srlinux hw variants 
# and aggregates them into a single file that is then processed by the yang browser.
# the script deploys a topology with all supported hw variants and extracts the features first

# the script first creates a json file per each platform with the features extracted from the platform using `info from state system features` command
# then it aggregates all the json files into a single file that is then processed by the yang browser

# note, that some features for platforms prior to 24.3.1 release reported by the platform might not be present in the YANG, which cause the pyang to error.
# to date the following features were identified as invalid for D2L platform, they have to be removed from the JSON file before `generate.sh` script is called
